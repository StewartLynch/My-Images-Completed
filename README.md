# My Images 5 Part Series for SwiftUI

This is the completed project for my YouTube series adding two UIViewRepresentables to a SwiftUI project so that you can select photos from the Photo Album or take a photo with the camera.

The project spends a lot of time building out the UI so that all errors are handled properly and presented as Alerts to the user

Project uses Xcode 13 and iOS 15
